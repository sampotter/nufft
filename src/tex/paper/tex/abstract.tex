\section*{Abstract}

The nonuniform fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a class of algorithms
which brackets the FFT with a pair of interpolating maps which have
complexity equal or superior to the FFT (generally $O(n \log n)$,
where $n$ is the size of the argument). A set of algorithms based on
the fast multipole method (FMM) providing sufficient complexity
guarantees exists~\cite{Dutt95fastfourierII}---each such algorithm
relies on a fast algorithm for the Cauchy or cotangent kernel. In this
work, a recent method for computing periodic sums is applied in order
to improve the speed and accuracy of these kernels, which is then
applied to the nonuniform FFT.\@ Error bounds and complexity
guarantees are proved, and numerical results are presented.
