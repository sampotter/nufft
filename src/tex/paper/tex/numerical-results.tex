\section{Numerical Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item \TODO\ include figure of approximated polynomial, possibly with
  ``off'' polynomials that are computed from checkpoints with higher
  condition number.
\item \TODO\ compare manually computing $c_0$ with our method of
  estimating $c_0$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \TODO\ include the plot which shows how our method for
    estimating $c_0$ diverges as $\delta \downarrow 0$.
  \item \TODO\ include a plot which accurately shows how our estimated
    $c_0$ is quite accurate as compared to manually computing $c_0$
    terms. Have the plot include several different choices of $\delta$
    (i.e. $\delta = 10^{-1}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-3}, \hdots$), use
    $L = 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, \hdots$---i.e.\ logarithmic on both
    scales.
  \end{itemize}
\item \TODO\ compare our Vandermonde inverse approach with using
  something like the SVD.\@
