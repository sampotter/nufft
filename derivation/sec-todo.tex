\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplify the summation
  $\sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z} \backslash \set{-n, \hdots, n}}
  \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}$ by defining a suitable set to sum over (what about
  convergence?).
\item Replace $\epsilon^{(p)}$ with $\varepsilon_p$.
\item Spruce up \texttt{itemize}s with numbered equations and labels
  and references.
\item Reference these equations appropriately throughout the text.
\item Make appropriate references to source papers where needed.
\item Define macros for commonly used notation to make it easier to
  change the notation later.
\item Make slightly better choices for variables for some indices that
  we're using, e.g.\ there's a clash between two different $l$'s
  right now.
\item Can we actually do anything using the finite difference operator
  stuff?
\item Figure out complexity.
\item Implement periodic summation algorithm.
\item Figure out choice of $x_*$
  so that it doesn't need to be passed in as a parameter to
  anything\ldots
\item \st{Consider $N - 1 \longrightarrow N$
  to avoid $\sum_{n=-(N-1)}^{N-1}$ (replace with $\sum_{n=-N}^N$).}
\item \st{Switch to bin sort.} \emph{Maybe discuss why this didn't work out.}
\item Is $\epsilon^{(p)}(y,x) = \epsilon^{(p)}(y, x + 2\pi)$?
\item Make a table out of definitions to make them easier to read.
\end{enumerate}
