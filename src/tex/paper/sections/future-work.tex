\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item \TODO\ talk about constant-$Q$ transform.
\item \TODO\ talk about possibility of ``stencil'' for adaptive FMM w.r.t.:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item application to constant-$Q$ transform,
  \item and application to FMRI imaging?
  \end{itemize}
\item \TODO\ talk about possibility of parallelizing (Qi Hu's approach
  for a heterogeneous system).
\item \TODO\ using Chebyshev basis instead of monomial basis, esp.\ w.r.t.:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item talk about relation to $c_m$'s for $m > 0$,
  \item and improved FMM convergence.
  \end{itemize}
\item \TODO\ talk about speeding up Cauchy kernel and how it will also
  be useful for speeding up FMM rotation operators.
\item \TODO\ Chebyshev interpolation/Vandermonde matrix stuff\ldots?
\item \TODO\ complex checkpoints and figure.
\item \TODO\ extend to multiple dimensions\ldots
\end{itemize}
