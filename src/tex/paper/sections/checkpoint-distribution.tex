\section{Checkpoint Distribution}

The distribution of the checkpoints
$\phiargcp_0, \hdots, \phiargcp_{\numcps-1}$ can have a significant
effect on the accuracy of the periodic summation method. The Cauchy
kernel was found to be very poorly conditioned depending on the
checkpoint distribution. The decomposition
$\m{R} = \vandermondefactor\uppertrifactor$ reveals the reason---one of its
factors is a Vandermonde matrix, which is known to be very poorly
conditioned, in general. The determinant of $\vandermondefactor$ is given
by:
\begin{align}
  \det(\vandermondefactor) = \prod_{0 \leq \cpindex < \cpindex' < \numcps} (\fitarg_\cpindex - \fitarg_{\cpindex'}).
\end{align}
A necessary condition for the algorithm to work, then, is for the
checkpoints to be unique---if any are equal, $\vandermondefactor$ is
singular. However, beyond this, if the checkpoints are spread too far
apart, the determinant quickly becomes unbounded, resulting in a
poorly conditioned fitting matrix. As our matrix decomposition
requires us to fix $\persumindex$ for each $\phiargcp_\cpindex$, we simply let
$\persumindex = \pm 1$.
