\section{Computation of $\persumcoef{0}$}

The first column of the fitting matrix $\m{R}$ is zero, which prevents
the preceding least squares fitting procedure from recovering
$\persumcoef{0}$. For some problems, this does not present a problem,
but for this one it does, and a method of computing $\persumcoef{0}$
is necessary. As it happens, approximating $\persumcoef{0}$ from:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:c0-direct}
  \persumcoef{0} = \sum_{\persumindex\notin\persumdomain}\sum_{\unifptindex=0}^{\bandlimit-1} \frac{{(-1)}^k \unifval{\unifptindex}}{\unifpt{\unifptindex} + 2\pi(\persumindex - 1)}
\end{align}
is unrealistic due to slow convergence---the series is similar to the
alternating harmonic series, for instance. Other methods have been
suggested~\cite{periodic-sums}.

Empirically, the coefficients $\persumcoef{m}$ are small for $m >
0$. Then, for some small $\eps > 0$, we should have:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:g-approx-for-c0}
  \unifval{\unifptindex} \approx \tfrac{1}{\bandlimit} \sin(\bandlimit{} \cdot (\unifpt{\unifptindex} + \eps)/2) (\persumcoef{0} + \phinear(\unifpt{\unifptindex} + \eps)).
\end{align}
This suggests that we can approximate $\persumcoef{0}$ by solving:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:c0-min-prob}
  \persumcoef{0} \approx \min_c \sum_{\unifptindex=0}^{\bandlimit-1} \parens{\unifval{\unifptindex} - \tfrac{1}{K} \sin(\bandlimit{} \cdot (\unifpt{\unifptindex} + \eps)/2) (\persumcoef{0} + \phinear(\unifpt{\unifptindex} + \eps))}^2.
\end{align}
If we let
$s_\unifptindex = \tfrac{1}{\bandlimit{}} \sin(\bandlimit{} \cdot
(\unifpt{\unifptindex} + \eps)/2)$ and
$\phi_\unifptindex = \phinear(\unifpt{\unifptindex} + \eps)$, then the
analytic solution to (\ref{eq:c0-min-prob}) is:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:c0-minimizer}
  \persumcoef{0} \approx \frac{\sum_{\unifptindex=0}^{\bandlimit-1} s_\unifptindex(\unifval{\unifptindex} - s_\unifptindex\phi_\unifptindex)}{\sum_{k=0}^{\bandlimit-1} s_\unifptindex^2}.
\end{align}
Despite this method's heuristic nature, it was found to compute
accurate approximations to $\persumcoef{0}$ in essentially constant
time as compared to the direct method mentioned earlier. However, it
should be noted that choosing $\eps$ to be too small can be
problematic.

\begin{itemize}
\item \TODO\ add figure showing divergence.
\item \TODO\ try using the coefficients $\persumcoef{m}$ for $m>0$ to
  recover even more accurately\ldots If this isn't possible, make sure
  to indicate why (compare \texttt{cest\_new} with \texttt{cest} in
  \texttt{sanitycheck.py}).
