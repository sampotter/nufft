* Applications

** Audio
   - Probably nothing interesting in terms of nonuniform nodes in
     space, but as far as nonuniform frequency nodes go, maybe there
     are some audio applications? Could compute the FFT at dyadic
     frequencies... How would this compare to the wavelet transform?
     Are there compression applications? (e.g. signals which only have
     power at known frequencies... sort of along the same lines as the
     dyadic thing...)

* C++ Implementation
  - [ ] Try out using Boost.Optional for the bookmarks instead of
    using a pair of -1's to indicate no bookmark.
  - [ ] Alternative bookmark data structures to try:
	- [ ] Heap-based
	- [ ] Linear probing (i.e. no buckets) implementation
  - [ ] Play around with the ~inline~ keyword for optimization.
