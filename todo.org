* Project Todo
  - [ ] Get Gadfly's plotting working.
	- [ ] eps
	- [ ] TikZ
  - [ ] Numerical tests for check points.
  - [ ] Numerical tests for interpolation.
  - [ ] Analysis for check points.
  - [ ] Forward interpolation derivation.
  - [ ] Complexity analysis.
  - [ ] Adaptive FMM.
  - [ ] Comparison with Potts's library.
  - [ ] Get cluster access.
  - [ ] Compare final performance with results from Dott & Rokhlin II.
  - [ ] Find some applications...
  - [ ] Figure out what the deal with computing Bernoulli numbers is...

* Applications

** Audio
   - Probably nothing interesting in terms of nonuniform nodes in
     space, but as far as nonuniform frequency nodes go, maybe there
     are some audio applications? Could compute the FFT at dyadic
     frequencies... How would this compare to the wavelet transform?
     Are there compression applications? (e.g. signals which only have
     power at known frequencies... sort of along the same lines as the
     dyadic thing...)

** OEIS
   - http://oeis.org/A046990
	 - numerators of Taylor series of log(cos(x))
   - http://oeis.org/A046991
	 - denominators of Taylor series of log(cos(x))
* C++ Implementation
  - [ ] Replace ~std::vector~ with ~boost::numeric::ublas::vector~?
  - [ ] Figure out how to deal with domain and range types -- if this
    is even necessary...
  - [ ] Try out using Boost.Optional for the bookmarks instead of
    using a pair of -1's to indicate no bookmark.
  - [ ] Alternative bookmark data structures to try:
	- [ ] Heap-based
	- [ ] Linear probing (i.e. no buckets) implementation
  - [ ] Play around with the ~inline~ keyword for optimization.
  - [ ] Factor out Kahan summation for reuse...
  - [ ] Kahan product?
  - [ ] Make ~p~ a template parameter to enable use of arrays on the stack...
  - [ ] Look into Shewchuk summation...
* Optimization
** General
   - [ ] Put EVERYTHING on the stack/or preallocate all memory used
   - [ ] Remove dependance on boost (for compilation speed)
   - [ ] Diagram algorithm to try and figure out best way to move memory around
   - [ ] Sum directly into coefficient vectors instead of using an intermediate workspace
   - [ ] Don't use maps -- or at least don't use STL maps?
   - [ ] don't unnecessarily propagate coefficients that aren't there...
   - [ ] SSE/SIMD?
   - [ ] use a heap for the index finder?
** Eventually
   - [ ] parallelize
	 - OpenMP?
	 - C++11 threads?
	 - TBB?
** Things to try autotuning
   - [ ] Whether or not functions are inline
   - [ ] Duff's device for loop unrolling (maybe this can be done using TMP?)
   - [ ] Loop tiling
   - [ ] Index types
